This website will help you with your studies but also give you some leisure. It will have a schedule, a sportsnet web page,
and a social media section. It will have a google calendar that connects will all of your accounts. 

The schedule will help you keep track with your classes while the social media and sportnet sections give you something to have fun 
with on the website.

I have completed everything that I want to do: a nav bar with a dropdown, a sportnet page, a schedule, and a social media section.

I want to put a feed of the buses near by that tell you what time they come at. I also want to put a login so that you can have access to your own schedule by just typing it in.
